# DS 2.3: Data Science in Production

## Course Description

This course covers the tools and techniques commonly utilized for production machine learning in industry. Students learn how to provide web interfaces for training machine learning or deep learning models with Flask and Docker. Students will deploy models in the cloud through Amazon Web Services (AWS), gather and process data from the web, and display information for consumption in advanced web applications using Plotly and D3.js. Students use PySpark to make querying even the largest data stores manageable.

## Why you should know this

In this course you will acquire a set of key skills expected of Data Scientists and Data Engineers

## Class Assignments

### Coming Soon!

<!--
* HW1: Deploying a Machine Learning or Deep Learning (ML/DL) model to AWS (Amazon Web Services) without Docker
* HW2: Application Programming Interface (API) on AWS that logs user interactions when working with the ML/DL model. Create a MongoDB or SQL Database. User interactions with Flask-Keras API will be written into the database (DB), including the image file name, the prediction result and date for MNIST application.
* HW3: For the Titanic dataset, use PySpark to get the same result as we got with Pandas
