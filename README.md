# DS 2.3: Data Science in Production

## Course Description

This course covers the tools and techniques commonly utilized for production machine learning in industry. Students learn how to provide web interfaces for training machine learning or deep learning models with Flask and Docker. Students will deploy models in the cloud through Amazon Web Services (AWS), gather and process data from the web, and display information for consumption in advanced web applications using Plotly and D3.js. Students use PySpark to make querying even the largest data stores manageable.

## Why you should know this

In this course you will acquire a set of key skills connecting data science and data modeling with the back end and front end web tools allow you to deploy models to the web. Mastering these skills will make you a more versatile Data Scientist or Data Engineer.

## Course Specifics

**Course Delivery**: Online | 7 weeks | 13 sessions

**Course Credits**: 3 units | 37.5 Seat Hours | 75 Total Hours

## Prerequisites:  

- [DS 2.1](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/DS-2.1-Machine-Learning)

## Learning Outcomes

Students by the end of the course will be able to:

1. Implement Advanced Visualizations using a Chart.js/D3.js Frontend, and a Python Backend
1. Implement a Machine Learning or Deep Learning model on a Web App using Flask and Flask-RESTPlus
1. Understand containers and be familiar with the Docker ecosystem 
1. Dockerize a Flask Web App containing a Machine Learning or Deep Learning Model and deploy it on Heroku, and also on AWS (Amazon Web Services)
1. Understand the PySpark ecosystem and work on Big Data using PySpark, H2O and Pandas
