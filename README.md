# DS 2.3: Data Science in Production

## Course Description

This course covers the tools and techniques commonly utilized for production machine learning in industry. Students learn how to provide web interfaces for training machine learning or deep learning models with Flask and Docker. Students will deploy models in the cloud through Amazon Web Services (AWS), gather and process data from the web, and display information for consumption in advanced web applications using Plotly and D3.js. Students use PySpark to make querying even the largest data stores manageable.

### Why you should know this (optional)

In this course you will acquire a set of key skills expected of Data Scientists and Engineers

## Course Specifics

**Course Delivery**: online | 7 weeks | 13 sessions

**Course Credits**: 3 units | 37.5 Seat Hours | 75 Total Hours

## Prerequisites:  

- [DS 2.1](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/DS-2.1-Machine-Learning)

## Learning Outcomes

Students by the end of the course will be able to:

1. Implement Machine Learning or Deep Learning on a Web App using Flask and Flask-RESTPlus
1. Dockerize the Flask Web App and develop it on Amazon Web Services (AWS)
1. Read large datasets from AWS Simple Storage Services (S3) through the Boto  python interface
1. Implement Advanced Visualizations using a Chart.js/D3.js Frontend, and a Python Backend
1. Work on Big Data using PySpark, H2O and Pandas

## Class Assignments



* HW1: Deploying a Machine Learning or Deep Learning (ML/DL) model to AWS (Amazon Web Services) without Docker
* HW2: Application Programming Interface (API) on AWS that logs user interactions when working with the ML/DL model. Create a MongoDB or SQL Database. User interactions with Flask-Keras API will be written into the database (DB), including the image file name, the prediction result and date for MNIST application.
* HW3: For the Titanic dataset, use PySpark to get the same result as we got with Pandas

### Projects

- Coming Soon!

**All projects will require a minimum of 10 commits, and must take place throughout the entirety of the course**

- **Good Example:** 40+ commits throughout the length of the course, looking for a healthy spattering of commits each week (such as 3-5 per day).
- **Bad Example:** 10 commits on one day during the course and no others. Students who do this will be at severe risk of not passing the class.
- **Unacceptable Example:** 2 commits the day before a project is due. Students who do this should not expect to pass the class.

#### Why are we doing this?

We want to encourage best practices that you will see working as a professional software engineer. Breaking up a project by doing a large amount of commits helps engineers in the following ways:

- It's much easier to retrace your steps if you break your project/product/code up into smaller pieces
- It helps with being able to comprehend the larger problem, and also will help with your debugging (i.e. finding exactly when you pushed that piece of broken code)
- It allows for more streamlined, iterative communication in your team, as it's much easier to hand off a small change to someone (updating a function) than a huge one (changed the architecture of the project)

Through this requirement, we hope to encourage you to think about projects with an iterative, modular mindset. Doing so will allow you to break projects down into smaller milestones that come together to make your fully-realized solution.

### Final Exam

-  **Passing the exam is a requirement for passing the class.**
- You will have 2 hours to complete this exam - it will be in class using paper and pencil, or a format of the instructor's choosing
- There are no retakes of the exam.
- If you have a disability that needs an accommodation such as extended time or a different format, please take advantage of our [accommodations program](make.sc/disability-policy).
